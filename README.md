#GenomicsSampleAPIs

This repository contains sample API implementations that use https://github.com/Intel-HLS/GenomicsDB as the backend for storing data. There are 2 sample API implementations:

1. A GA4GH compliant RESTful query interface for GenomicsDB which we also call Variant Store. For more detailed information about setting up the Variant Store, interacting with the Variant Store, or further documentation on a specific module or library see the [wiki](https://github.com/Intel-HLS/GenomicsSampleAPIs/wiki).
1. A custom Python API implementation. For more detailed information about setting up the Python API and interacting with it, or further documentation on a specific module or library see the [wiki](https://github.com/Intel-HLS/GenomicsSampleAPIs/wiki/Python-API).
