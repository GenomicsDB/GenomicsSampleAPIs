#How to contribute

## Thank you!

We are excited you are interested in improving the sample APIs  Thanks for taking the interest and time!

## Code Layout

## Code Style

We are somewhat loose on coding style.  Generally try to stay consistant with the naming, spacing, and layout of the language as used thus far.

### Python

Generally [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) is a good goal, but not an absolute requirement.  Line length is done for readability, so not strictly 79 chars.

- Functions are usually named with under_scores or mixedCase.
- Classes are usually named with CapitalizedWords
- variables are usually named with lowercase
